# Notes

**[Google's Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)** was used for the LLM as required by the assignment.  

## Hallucinations

`Programming Languages: Concepts and Constructs` by Ravi Sethi initially hallucinated as being titled `Programming Languages: Design and Implementation` by Ravi Sethi

Gemini repeatedly referenced the languages *Lisp*, *Forth*, and *APL* as being examples of esoteric programming languages even though they are not.

## Unclear Points and empty statements

Section "Academic Papers and Books" originally contained this subheading which sounds nice but provides no actual detals:

>    Research papers on specific esoteric languages: Many researchers have published papers on individual esoteric languages, exploring their unique features, design principles, and potential applications. These papers can provide valuable insights into the impact of these languages on the broader programming landscape.
